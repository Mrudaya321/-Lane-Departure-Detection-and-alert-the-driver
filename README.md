# -Lane-Departure-Detection-and-alert-the-driver
 Modern vehicles require reliable systems to enhance road safety and prevent 
unintentional lane departures, which are a major cause of accidents. Traditional 
lane detection methods often struggle with real-world challenges such as poor 
lighting, worn or obscured lane markings, and varying road conditions. The problem 
is to design and implement an effective lane departure detection system using a 
camera-based vision pipeline that can robustly identify lane boundaries and detect 
departures, providing timely warnings to the driver under diverse driving situations
